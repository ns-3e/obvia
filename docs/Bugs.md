## Performance Issues

### Known Performance Considerations
- **Large Library Loading**: Libraries with 1000+ books may experience slow loading
- **PDF Text Extraction**: Large PDF files (>50MB) may timeout during text extraction
- **Semantic Search**: Large embedding databases may impact search performance
- **Bulk Scanning**: Rapid scanning of many books may overwhelm the API rate limits

### Optimization Strategies
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination for large result sets
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data (book covers, search results)
- **Background Processing**: Move heavy operations to background tasks
- **Database Optimization**: Add indexes for common query patterns
- **Image Optimization**: Compress and cache book cover images

---

## Security Considerations

### File Upload Security
- **File Type Validation**: Only allow PDF and image files
- **File Size Limits**: Enforce maximum file size limits
- **Virus Scanning**: Consider implementing virus scanning for uploaded files
- **Secure Storage**: Ensure uploaded files are stored securely

### API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for external API calls
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use parameterized queries
- **XSS Prevention**: Sanitize user-generated content
