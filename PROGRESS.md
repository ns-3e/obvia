Obvia ‚Äî Personal Intelligent Library Manager (Single-User)

Goal: Build a minimal, single-user app to manage a personal book library with ISBN lookup (incl. barcode scan), enriched metadata, intelligent notes, basic + semantic search, and simple recommendations.
Stack: Backend = Python 3.11, Django 5, DRF, MySQL 8; Frontend = React 18 (Vite), Tailwind CSS.
Packaging: Docker (multi-stage) + docker-compose.
Style: Sleek, modern, monochrome (grays/black/white), dark/light.

Working Rules for the AI Agent
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Track progress: Maintain a top-level PROGRESS.md with the checklist below. Mark each item as [x] only after building + testing it.
	‚Ä¢	üîÅ Work in steps: You do not need to build everything at once. Implement in logical batches (Phase 1, 2, 3‚Ä¶).
	‚Ä¢	üß™ Test continuously: Add minimal tests and/or run flows to verify each feature before checking it off.
	‚Ä¢	üßæ Document: Keep README.md current (setup, run, endpoints, screenshots/gifs).
	‚Ä¢	üß© Simplicity first: Single user only; no signup/login/auth. Avoid unnecessary abstractions.
	‚Ä¢	üß∞ No Makefile: Use npm/pip scripts and docker-compose commands in the README.
	‚Ä¢	üîê Privacy: Local/private use. Warn that only PDFs the user has rights to should be uploaded.

‚∏ª
Here‚Äôs a Cursor-ready checklist prompt for your Phase 11‚Äîbulk scanning via webcam with live chime and a live import queue. It‚Äôs designed for a single-user app (no auth), keeps things simple, and tells the agent to track progress in PROGRESS.md and work in steps.

‚∏ª

Phase 11 ‚Äî Bulk Webcam Scan & Auto-Import (No Code; Checklist for Cursor Agent)

Goal: Enable live, continuous barcode scanning via the webcam. When a new unique ISBN/EAN-13 is detected, play a ping/chime, add the book to a live queue panel on the right, and auto-fetch metadata (Google Books ‚Üí Open Library fallback) to insert into the local library without extra clicks.

Working Rules for the AI Agent
	‚Ä¢	Track progress: Update PROGRESS.md and check off each item only after you‚Äôve built & tested it.
	‚Ä¢	Work in steps: You can split Phase 11 into sub-steps (11.1, 11.2, ‚Ä¶) and complete them iteratively.
	‚Ä¢	Document: Add user instructions, known limitations, and screenshots/GIFs to README.md.

‚∏ª

11.1 UI/UX ‚Äî Bulk Scanner Page ‚úÖ
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Add a route "Bulk Scan" accessible from the main UI (e.g., /scan or from library detail page).
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Layout:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Left: Live camera preview with scanning overlay (reticle/guide box) and status text (e.g., "Ready", "Scanning‚Ä¶", "Detected 978‚Ä¶", "Duplicate skipped").
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Right: Live queue panel listing newly scanned books (cover, title, author, ISBN, status). Latest at top.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Top/Toolbar: Select Target Library (dropdown), Start/Stop scanning, Clear Queue, and a simple Help/tips link.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Accessibility:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Ensure focus states and keyboard support (Start: Enter, Stop: Esc, Clear: Cmd/Ctrl-K).
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Provide text alternatives for screen readers.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Monochrome styling consistent with app: borders, rounded corners, subtle shadows.

‚úÖ Acceptance check: Page renders, controls present, no camera access yet.

‚∏ª

11.2 Webcam Access & Scanner Lifecycle ‚úÖ
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Request webcam permissions and start stream only when user clicks Start (avoid auto-prompt on page load).
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Show clear messaging if camera permissions are denied; provide retry button.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Provide Start/Stop buttons that:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Start ‚Üí attach video stream & scanning loop.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Stop ‚Üí pause scanning loop and release tracks.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Handle device selection (default to environment/back camera on mobile if available).

‚úÖ Acceptance check: Start/Stop reliably attach/detach the camera stream without errors; status text updates accordingly.

‚∏ª

11.3 Barcode Detection Loop (Client-Side) ‚úÖ
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Implement a frame sampling loop (e.g., ~6‚Äì12 FPS or throttled) to decode EAN-13/ISBN-13 only (ignore other symbologies).
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Apply basic pre-processing: ensure good exposure and contrast; allow decoder to handle rotation.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Add debounce & cool-down (e.g., 800‚Äì1500 ms) to prevent repeat detections from a static frame.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Duplicate guard: maintain an in-memory Set of ISBNs seen in this session (and optionally cross-check against server to skip already-owned books).

‚úÖ Acceptance check: Moving a barcode in/out of the frame produces at most one detection per unique barcode within the session.

‚∏ª

11.4 ISBN Validation & Normalization ‚úÖ
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Accept only EAN-13 values that begin with 978/979 and pass a check-digit verification.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Normalize to ISBN-13 string (digits only).
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ If a UPC-A is read, attempt to convert to ISBN-13 only when safe; otherwise ignore.

‚úÖ Acceptance check: Invalid or non-book barcodes are ignored; only valid ISBN-13 makes it to the queue.

‚∏ª

11.5 Chime & Feedback ‚úÖ
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ On first successful unique detection, play a short chime/ping (preload audio; respect user gesture policies).
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Visual flash or brief badge animation near the queue.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ If duplicate within session, play a softer tick or show "Duplicate skipped" (no chime).

‚úÖ Acceptance check: Distinct audio/visual feedback for new vs duplicate.

‚∏ª

11.6 Auto-Enrichment & Import Workflow ‚úÖ
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Immediately after a unique ISBN is detected:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ POST to existing ingest endpoint (/api/books/ingest) to normalize & create/find the Book (Google Books ‚Üí Open Library fallback).
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ POST to add to library (/api/libraries/{libraryId}/books) with the selected target library.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Update the queue row status in real-time:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ States: queued ‚Üí fetching ‚Üí imported (or skipped if already owned, error if failed).
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Show the book cover/title/author once metadata returns.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ If the target library changes mid-session, new scans should import to the new selection; existing queue items keep their original target.

‚úÖ Acceptance check: New scans appear, trigger API calls, update to "imported" or "skipped/error," and the book shows in the target library list.

‚∏ª

11.7 Queue Management & Controls ‚úÖ
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Queue shows latest first, paginates if long, and is cleared by user action only.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Provide Remove action per row (to dismiss from view; doesn't delete library).
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Provide Clear Queue button with confirm dialog.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Allow Export CSV of the session (ISBN, title, status, timestamp) for record-keeping.

‚úÖ Acceptance check: Queue is usable, removable, exportable; no accidental deletion of library contents.

‚∏ª

11.8 Error Handling & Offline Resilience ‚úÖ
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ If ingest fails (network, rate-limit, provider down), retry with backoff up to N times.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ On persistent failure, mark error and allow Retry per item.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ If offline:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Cache scanned ISBNs in memory, queue API calls until back online.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Display an "Offline ‚Äî queued X items" banner; auto-resume when online.

‚úÖ Acceptance check: Simulate offline/failed calls; verify retries, clear messaging, and manual retry control.

‚∏ª

11.9 Performance & Safety ‚úÖ
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Throttle frame processing and avoid main-thread jank (e.g., requestAnimationFrame cadence or timers).
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Ensure audio does not stack (debounce chime).
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Memory safety: prune in-session "seen ISBNs" if queue gets very large (>1k), but keep UI responsive.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Avoid spamming APIs: add a small per-ISBN in-flight lock to prevent double posts.

‚úÖ Acceptance check: Sustained scanning of many books is smooth; API calls are one-per-unique ISBN.

‚∏ª

11.10 Telemetry (Local Only) ‚úÖ
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Console logs (dev only) for detections, duplicates, API outcomes.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Optional simple counters on the page: Scanned, Imported, Skipped, Errors.

‚úÖ Acceptance check: Counters update reliably; logs are readable in dev.

‚∏ª

11.11 Documentation & Short Demo ‚úÖ
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Update README.md:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ How to use Bulk Scan (permissions, lighting tips, distance/angle).
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ How to select a target library.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ What the statuses mean; how to retry; how to export CSV.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Notes on duplicates, offline mode, and troubleshooting camera issues.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Add a short GIF/screenshots to demonstrate scanning ‚Üí chime ‚Üí queue ‚Üí imported.

‚úÖ Acceptance check: Docs are clear; a new user can complete a bulk scan session end-to-end.

‚∏ª

Phase 11 ‚Äî Final Acceptance Criteria
	‚Ä¢	Webcam scanning reliably detects unique ISBN-13 (978/979) and debounces duplicates.
	‚Ä¢	A chime plays on each new unique detection; duplicates are skipped with distinct feedback.
	‚Ä¢	Each new detection auto-ingests metadata and adds the book to the selected library.
	‚Ä¢	The right-hand queue updates in real time with cover/title/status and supports remove/clear/export.
	‚Ä¢	Robust handling of errors, retries, and offline scenarios.
	‚Ä¢	Performance is smooth; no memory leaks; Start/Stop behaves correctly.
	‚Ä¢	README.md updated; PROGRESS.md reflects completed checklist items.



Nice-to-Haves (If Time)
	‚Ä¢	CSV import/export of library
	‚Ä¢	Kindle highlights import (CSV/JSON)
	‚Ä¢	Browser extension stub to capture current page ‚Üí create book stub

‚∏ª

Acceptance Criteria (to check off before ‚ÄúDone‚Äù)
	‚Ä¢	Single-user app runs locally via docker compose up --build
	‚Ä¢	Add book by ISBN (barcode scan or manual), enrich via Google/Open Library
	‚Ä¢	View & edit book metadata; add tags, shelves, ratings
	‚Ä¢	Create notes (Markdown); list/filter books by tags/shelves/rating
	‚Ä¢	Basic search works (title/author/isbn)
	‚Ä¢	Recommendations visible on Book Detail (metadata-only)
	‚Ä¢	Upload PDFs; extracted text stored
	‚Ä¢	(If enabled) Semantic search returns relevant hits across metadata/notes/PDF text
	‚Ä¢	Monochrome, responsive UI; dark/light toggle
	‚Ä¢	README.md and PROGRESS.md up to date

‚∏ª

Implementation Hints (keep simple)
	‚Ä¢	Prefer functionality over perfection; ship minimal slices.
	‚Ä¢	For semantic search in small libraries, a basic cosine similarity can be fine before FAISS.
	‚Ä¢	If MySQL is heavy for first run, you may add a dev flag to use SQLite, but default to MySQL in Docker.
	‚Ä¢	Barcode: @zxing/browser EAN-13; handle permission errors gracefully with a manual ISBN input fallback.
	‚Ä¢	PDF text: pypdf first (no OCR); add OCR later only if needed.

‚∏ª

Agent Reminder: Update PROGRESS.md continuously. Break the build into steps. After each step, run and test the feature, then check the item off. If a step is blocked, note blockers and move to the next independent task.
